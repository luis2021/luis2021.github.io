My favorite vacations

All the year my family gathers money to travel on vacations. My favorite vacations were those of 2013. That year I traveled with my family to Madrid and Tenerife. I was very excited. It was the first time that I traveled to Europe. We arrived in Madrid at night. At the airport of Madrid, we needed to take a train to go to the carousel and claim our baggage. The airport of Madrid was very big and modern.
Madrid is a beautiful city. There are so many interesting places to visit such as Gate of the Sun, Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Metropolis Building and Temple of Debod. However, we stayed only for 4 days there, little time to visit the city. When we arrived in Madrid, we checked in the hotel and walked at the downtown. The hotel was spotless; the food was magnificent and it had friendly people. 
The third day we traveled by train to Toledo. The train ticket was cheap, and the trip was fast. Toledo has stone streets, amazing landscapes, walls and old buildings.
Then we went to Tenerife. Tenerife is an island with fascinating places. I enjoyed so much there. We stayed for 15 days. My uncle gave us a tour around the whole island. We visited different parks but my favorite was Siam Park. Siam Park is an amazing and enormous water park. There are too many slides and pools, furthermore, its slides are huge and there is a pool with 2 meter waves. This day was outstanding.
