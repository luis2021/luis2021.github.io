My favorite vacations

All the year my family gathers money for travel on ours vacations. My favorite vacations was those of 2013. This year I traveled with my family to Madrid and Tenerife. I was very excited. It was the first time that I traveled to Europe. We arrived in Madrid at night. At the airport of Madrid, we needed to take a train for go to the carousel and claim our baggage. The airport of Madrid was very big and modern.
Madrid is a beautiful city. There are so many interesting places to visit such as Gate of the Sun, Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Metropolis Building and Temple of Debod. However, we stayed only for 4 days there, little time for visit the city. When we arrived to Madrid, we check in the hotel and walk at the downtown. The hotel was spotless; the food was magnificent and it has friendly people. 
The third day we traveled by train to Toledo. The train ticket was cheap, and the trip was fast. Toledo has stone streets, amazing landscapes, walls and old buildings.
Then we went to Tenerife. Tenerife is an island with fascinating places. I enjoyed so much there. We stayed for 15 days. My uncle give us a tour by whole the island. We visited different parks but my favorite was Siam Park. Siam Park is an amazing and enormous water park. There are too many slides and pools, furthermore, its slides are huge and there is a pool with 2 meter waves. This day was outstanding.
